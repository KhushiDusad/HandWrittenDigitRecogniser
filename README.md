# HandWrittenDigitRecogniser
The Handwritten Digit Recognizer project aims to develop a deep learning model that can accurately identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model will be built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it will consist of a Sequential neural network architecture with multiple layers, including an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer.
## Dataset
The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, one of the most widely used benchmark datasets in the field of computer vision. This dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9) in grayscale, each of size 28x28 pixels.
